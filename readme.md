# Single Column Website

Your goal is to recreate the website below, replacing the personal specifics with your own images. 

## Requirements
- Fork and clone this repository. 
- Your page should have at least 6 semantic `div` sections, including a `<header>` and a `<footer>`. 
- The header must contain links to those sections. 
>Note: You'll need to figure out how to link to `id` names for this functionality to work.
- At least one of your sections needs to use a background image.
- One of your sections needs to have at least four pictures.
- Use a hexidecimal color code at least once.

## Bonus
- Import and apply a `font-family` from Google Fonts
- Use positioning to make your header a "fixed header"
- Use the `:hover` psuedoclass to add visual styles when a user hovers over something


## CSS Property Example
The sample website was styled with the following CSS properties (however, don't feel obliged to use these as you may find different but equally effective solutions):

- display
- background-size
- background-img
- background-color
- color
- font-family
- font-weight
- text-decoration
- text-align
- line-height
- height
- width
- margin

If you want your page to link to GitHub or LinkedIn, you can use the following links in the `src` attribute of your `img` tag:
